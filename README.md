# Smoking and Drinking Classification using Machine Learning

This project analyzes and classifies individual behavior based on smoking and drinking habits using machine learning models. The dataset includes features such as gender, smoking status, and drinking status.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is a CSV file containing health-related information. The key columns include:
- `sex`
- `SMK_stat_type_cd` (smoking status)
- `DRK_YN` (drinking status)
- And other related features

## 🧠 Models Used

The following machine learning algorithms were implemented:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- KMeans Clustering (for unsupervised analysis)

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

Each model was evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

## 🔧 Libraries & Tools

- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn (for oversampling)
- matplotlib, seaborn
- Google Colab

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the `CSE437_Group26.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab
3. Upload the dataset or mount Google Drive as shown in the notebook
4. Run each cell to train and evaluate the models
